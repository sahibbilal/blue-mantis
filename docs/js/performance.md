# JavaScript Performance
JavaScript can have a big impact on browser performance. A few things to keep in mind:

1. Avoid the `scroll` event (unless using it within a Controller). Even then, the [Intersection Observer API ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) is much better for performance.
2. Avoid querying elements multiple times when it can be done once and assigned to a `const` variable.
3. Avoid the mouse and hover events unless absolutely necessary (also not great for accessibility). Use CSS when possible.
4. Avoid scripts that cause unexpected movement in the page. See [Cumulative Layout Shift ↗](https://web.dev/cls/).
5. Follow the [Global vs Block Assets best practices](/docs/best-practices/global-vs-block-assets.md) and avoid adding global JS unless necessary.
