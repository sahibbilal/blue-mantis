# Reusable Blocks
Reusable blocks are a core WordPress post type that allows saving a block or group of blocks that can then be displayed elsewhere on the site. This allows reusing of the same content in multiple places across the site. If a reusable block is changed in one location, that same content will be changed everywhere else it is used.

The Propel WordPress Framework adds a menu item in the dashboard to allow for easy access to the reusable blocks.
