# Block Patterns
Block patterns are a core WordPress feature that allow setting predefined arrangements/layouts of blocks. These blocks can then be added to a page/post in the same way other blocks are added (via the `Patterns` tab). Unlike [Reusable Blocks](/docs/blocks/reusable-blocks.md), once a pattern is added to a page/post, it can then be changed without changing the original pattern. It is just a starting point for the creation of pages/posts.

The Propel WordPress Framework adds the `Block Patterns` custom post type in the dashboard which allows the creation of block patterns via the editor. This is often used by the 829 production team to create arrangements of blocks frequently used across the site.
