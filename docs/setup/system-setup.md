# System Setup

MacOS is the recommended OS (Windows has been lightly tested but might be buggy). The following global packages need to be installed (recommend installing via [Brew ↗](https://brew.sh/)):

* [Composer ↗](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/composer): `brew install composer`
* [Gulp CLI ↗](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gulp-cli): `brew install gulp-cli`
* [NVM ↗](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/yarn): `brew install nvm`
* [Node 16 ↗](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/yarn): `nvm install 16`

[Local ↗](https://localwp.com/) is the recommended software for setting up local environments, and [VS Code ↗](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended IDE. This documentation will assume you are using both.
