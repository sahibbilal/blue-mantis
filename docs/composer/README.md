# Composer
[Composer ↗](https://getcomposer.org/) is the dependency manager used to install PHP packages. Its dependencies get installed with the `npm run setup` task during [Local Setup](/docs/setup/local-setup.md) but can also be installed on its own with `composer install`.

Composer is used in the Propel WordPress Framework to install:

* WordPress Plugins
* [PHPCS](/docs/best-practices/linting/php-phpcs.md) utilities for linting PHP
