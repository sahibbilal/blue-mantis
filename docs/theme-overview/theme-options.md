# Theme Options
In the WordPress dashboard, the `Theme Options` setting contains a custom [ACF options pages ↗](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/options-page/) that are used for global ACF fields needed across the site.

By default, the following options pages exist:

## General
Used for fields used in multiple locations across the site, like the primary logo.

## Header
Used for fields specific to the header.

## Footer
Used for fields specific to the footer.

## Used Blocks
This page doesn't actually contain any ACF fields. Instead, it's a custom report of the block used across the site and where they are used. This same functionality can be copied when additional dashboard analytics are needed.
